            <h3 class="subtitle">Preparations</h3>
            <p>
                Make sure the game acually runs in Yuzu. There are plenty of tutorials out there on how to get Tears of the Kingdom up and running.
            </p>

            <h3 class="subtitle">Setup</h3>
            <p>
                Download <span class="code">totk_mc_batch_decompressor_release.zip</span> of the <a href="https://gamebanana.com/tools/13236">mc_decompressor</a> and unzip the contents.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                In Yuzu, click on <span class="code">File -> Open yuzu Folder</span>. This should open the Yuzu Folder in the explorer. The path might look something like this: <span class="code">C:/Users/USERNAME/AppData/Roaming/yuzu/</span>. 
                <br>
                Navigate to <span class="code">/sdmc/atmosphere/contents</span> and paste the folder <span class="code">0100F2C0115B6000</span>, which you just unzipped, in there.
            </p>


            <h3 class="subtitle">"Extraction"</h3>
            <p>
                Restart Yuzu and open the game. It will seemingly be stuck in the "loading" screen, but this is actually a good sign, as this means that the files are being exported.
                <br>
                After about 3 to 15 minutes, the game will finally load into the main menu. This means that the process has finished.
            </p>
            <p>
                Two new folders should now haven been created in the <span class="code">/sdmc</span> folder in the Yuzu folder. <span class="code">mc_output0</span> and <span class="code">mc_output1</span>. These two folders contain all the 3d models of TotK as <span class="code">.bfres</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can open these files with <a href="https://github.com/KillzXGaming/Switch-Toolbox">Switch-Toolbox</a> and also convert them into <span class="code">.dae</span> files, so they can be imported into software like Blender.
            </p>
